# nugetchromedriver
This program could download chromedriver from nuget automatically.

A few years ago, we wrote a webâ€‘scraping program for a client that could automatically update ChromeDriver. However, once the client put a firewall in place, issues began to occur.

The purpose of this script is to go directly to NuGet and automatically download the matching ChromeDriver version.
